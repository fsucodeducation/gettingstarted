# Getting Started with Github

### Step 1.
- Install git on your machine, and make a GitHub account.
	* [Github for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
	* [Github for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
	* [Github for Linux/Unix](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

- Sign up for a Github account at http://github.com/join

### Step 2.
- Create a local git respository on your machine
```
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ cd ~/Desktop
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ mkdir gettingstarted
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ cd gettingstarted/
```
- Initialize a git repository by running the `git init` command.
```
andrewwhitely:myproject andrewwhitely$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/andrewwhitely/Desktop/gettingstarted/.git/
```

### Step 3.
- Fork this repo (https://github.com/fsucodeducation/gettingstarted)
- Clone it to your gettingstarted directory that you created earlier.
- Create your own branch
```
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ cd ~/Desktop
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ mkdir gettingstarted
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ cd gettingstarted/
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ git clone https://github.com/fsucodeducation/gettingstarted.git
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ git branch andrewwhtiely
andrewwhitely:Desktop andrewwhitely$ git checkout andrewwhitely
```

### Step 4.
- Make an edit to the Contributors.md file, by adding your name and link to your own Github profile.

### Step 5.
- Log back onto Github, go to your gettingstarted repository, and open a new pull request. This will add your changes to the Codeducation repo.
